            <p>The <code>position</code> CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and <code>left</code> physical properties can be used to determine the final location of positioned elements.</p>

                <h2>Description for types of positioning</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A positioned element is an element whose computed position value is either relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky. (In other words, it's anything except static.)</li>
                    <li>A relatively positioned element is an element whose computed position value is relative. The top and bottom properties specify the vertical offset from its normal position; the left and right properties specify the horizontal offset.</li>
                    <li>An absolutely positioned element is an element whose computed position value is absolute or fixed. The top, right, bottom, and left properties specify offsets from the edges of the element's containing block. (The containing block is the ancestor relative to which the element is positioned.) The element establishes a new block formatting context (BFC) for its contents.</li>
                    <li>A stickily positioned element is an element whose computed position value is sticky. It's treated as relatively positioned until its containing block crosses a specified threshold (such as setting top to value other than auto) within its flow root (or the container it scrolls within), at which point it is treated as "stuck" until meeting the opposite edge of its containing block.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><mark>Note: Fixed positioning is similar to absolute positioning, with the exception that the element's containing block is the initial containing block established by the viewport, unlike the absolute position which element's containing black can be either a positioned ancestor element or the initial containing block.</mark></p>
