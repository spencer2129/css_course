                <p>CSS grid layout is designed to work alongside other parts of CSS, as part of a complete system for doing the layout.</p>

                <h2>Grid and flexbox</h2>
                <p>The basic difference is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension, either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two dimensional layout, rows, and columns at the same time. The two specifications both use box alignment features.</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Flexbox layout example</h3>
                    <pre><code>
                        HTML
                        &lt;div class="wrapper"&gt;
                            &lt;div&gt;One&lt;/div&gt;
                            &lt;div&gt;Two&lt;/div&gt;
                            &lt;div&gt;Three&lt;/div&gt;
                            &lt;div&gt;Four&lt;/div&gt;
                            &lt;div&gt;Five&lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;

                        CSS
                        * {
                            margin: 0;
                            padding: 0;
                            box-sizing: border-box;
                        }
                        .wrapper {
                            border-radius: 5px;
                            border: #d9480f 2px solid;
                            background-color: #fff4e6;
                            width: 500px;
                            display: flex;
                            flex-wrap: wrap;
                        }
                        
                        .wrapper > div {
                            border: 2px solid #ffa94d;
                            border-radius: 5px;
                            background-color: #ffd8a8;
                            padding: 1em;
                            color: #d9480f;
                            flex: 1 1 150px;  
                        }
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>In the example above, two items have wrapped onto a new line. These items are sharing the avaiable space and not lining up underneath the items above. <mark>This is because when you wrap flex items, each new row (or column when working by column) is an independent flex line in the flex container.</mark> Space distribution happens across the flex line.</p>
                    <p>A common question then is how to make those items line up. This is where you want a two-dimensional layout method: You want to control the alignment by row and column, and this is where grid comes in.</p>

                    <h3>Same layout with Grid</h3>
                    <pre><code>
                        .wrapper {
                            display: grid;
                            grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
                          }
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>In this example we have three <code>1fr</code> column tracks. We do not need to anything on the items themseves; they will lay themselves out one into each cell of the created grid.</p>

                    <h3>Content out or layout in?</h3>
                    <p>There is another way to decide if you should use flexbox or grid. Flexbox works from the content out. An ideal use case is when you have a set of items and want to space them out evenly in a container. You let the size of the content decide how much individual space each item takes up. On the other hand, grid works from the layout in.  When you use grid you create a layout and then place items into it, or you allow the auto-placement rules to place items into the grid cells.</p>
                    <p><mark>If you're using flexbox and you find youself disabling some of the flexbility such as setting widths on a flex item to make it line up with other items in a row, a grid is likely a better choice.</mark></p>

                    <h3>Box alignment</h3>
                    <p>CSS box alignment properties are used in multiple layout modules such as flexbox and grid</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Auto-filling grid tracks</h3>
                    <p><code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 200px);</code></p>
                    <p>The grid will create as many 200 pixel column tracks as will fit in the container</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>A flexible number of tracks</h3>
                    <p><code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));</code></p>
                    <p>We create auto filled tracks with <code>minmax</code>, and we set the minimum size of 200 pixel and maxiumn to 1fr. Once the browser has worked out how many times 200 pixels will fit into the container, it will treat the 1fr maximum as an instructino to share out the reamining space between the items.</p>

                <h2>Grid and absolutely positioned elements</h2>

                <section>
                    <h3>A grid container as containing block</h3>
                    <p>To make the grid container a containing block, you need to add the position property to the container with a value of <code>relative</code>, just as you would make a containing block for any other absolutely positioned items. Once you have done this, if you give a grid item <code>position: absolute</code> it will take as its containing block the grid container or, if the item also has a grid position, the area of the grid it is placed into.</p>
                    <p>The item is taken out of flow, and the auto-placement rules now place items into the same space. The item doesn't cause any additional rows to be created as it would have if the item was not positioned absolutely.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>A grid container as parent</h3>
                    <p>If the absolutely positioned child has a grid container as a parent but that container does not create a new positioning context, then it is taken out of flow. The positioninng context is the element the absolutely positioned element is positioned realtive to. The positioning context will be whatever element creates a positioning context as is common to other layout methods. In our example, if we remove <code>position: relative</code> from the grid container, the positioning context is the viewport.</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>With a grid area as a parent</h3>
                    <p>If the absolutely positioned item is nested inside a grid area, then you can create a positioning context on that area. Below, we have a grid and a nested item inside .box3 of the grid. We gave box3 position relative, and then positioned the sub-item with the offset properties. The positioning context is the grid area. The absolute positioned item will be positioned inside .box3 item.</p>

                                containing block and so the absolute positioning offset values are
                                calculated in from the outer edges of the grid area.
