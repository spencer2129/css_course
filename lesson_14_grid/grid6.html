            <h1>Auto-placement in grid layout</h1>
            <p>CSS grid layout contains rules that control what ahppens when you create a grid and do not explicitly place some or all of the child items within the grid. When you don't need explicit control over content placement, this "auto-placement" is the simplest way of creating a grid for a set of items.</p>

                <h2>Default placement</h2>
                <p>If you don't give the items placement information, they automatically position themselves on the grid, placing one grid item in each cell.</p>

                <h2>Default rules for auto-placement</h2>
                <p>If you create a grid without placing any items, the child items will lay themselves out with one grid item in each grid cell in source-code order. <mark>The default flow is to arrage items by row.</mark> Grid will lay an item out in each cell of the first row. If you have created additional rows using the <code>grid-template-rows</code> property, then grid will continue placing items in these rows. <mark>If the grid does not have enough rows in the explicit grid to place all of the items new implicit rows will be created.</mark></p>

                    <h3>Sizing rows in the implicit grid</h3>
                    <p><mark>The default for automatically created rows in the implicit grid is for them to be auto-sized.</mark> This means that they will size themselves to according the content added to them without causing an overflow.</p> 
                    <p><mark>The size of the rows can be controlled using the property <code>grid-auto-rows</code></mark></p>

                    <h3>Sizing rows using minmax()</h3>
                    <p>By setting <code>grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);</code> we set each row to be at least 100px tall, while allowing each row to be as tall as needed.</p>

                    <h3>Sizing rows using a track listing</h3>
                    <p><pre><code>
                        .wrapper {
                            display: grid;
                            grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
                            gap: 10px;
                            grid-auto-rows: 100px 200px;
                          }
                    </code></pre></p>
                    <p>This example will create an initial implicit row track as 100 pixels and a second as 200 pixels. This patter will continue to repeat for as long as content is added to the implicit grid.</p>
