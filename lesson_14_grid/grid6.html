            <h1>Auto-placement in grid layout</h1>
            <p>CSS grid layout contains rules that control what ahppens when you create a grid and do not explicitly place some or all of the child items within the grid. When you don't need explicit control over content placement, this "auto-placement" is the simplest way of creating a grid for a set of items.</p>

                <h2>Default placement</h2>
                <p>If you don't give the items placement information, they automatically position themselves on the grid, placing one grid item in each cell.</p>

                <h2>Default rules for auto-placement</h2>
                <p>If you create a grid without placing any items, the child items will lay themselves out with one grid item in each grid cell in source-code order. <mark>The default flow is to arrage items by row.</mark> Grid will lay an item out in each cell of the first row. If you have created additional rows using the <code>grid-template-rows</code> property, then grid will continue placing items in these rows. <mark>If the grid does not have enough rows in the explicit grid to place all of the items new implicit rows will be created.</mark></p>

                    <h3>Sizing rows in the implicit grid</h3>
                    <p><mark>The default for automatically created rows in the implicit grid is for them to be auto-sized.</mark> This means that they will size themselves to according the content added to them without causing an overflow.</p> 
                    <p><mark>The size of the rows can be controlled using the property <code>grid-auto-rows</code></mark></p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Sizing rows using minmax()</h3>
                    <p>By setting <code>grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);</code> we set each row to be at least 100px tall, while allowing each row to be as tall as needed.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Sizing rows using a track listing</h3>
                    <p><pre><code>
                        .wrapper {
                            display: grid;
                            grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
                            gap: 10px;
                            grid-auto-rows: 100px 200px;
                          }
                    </code></pre></p>
                    <p>This example will create an initial implicit row track as 100 pixels and a second as 200 pixels. This patter will continue to repeat for as long as content is added to the implicit grid.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Auto-placement by column</h3>
                    <p><mark>You can have grid auto-place items by column by using the property <code>grid-auto-flow</code> with value of <code>column</code>.</mark></p>
                    <p>As with implicit row tracks, these column tracks will be auto sized, but you can control the size of the implicit column tracks with <code>grid-auto-columns</code>.</p>
                    <p>In this example we have a grid with three 200px high row tracks. We declare <code>grid-auto-flow: column;</code> to auto-place by column. With <code>grid-auto-columns: 300px 100px;</code>, the columns created will alternate between being 300px wide and 100px wide until there are enough column tracks to hold all of the items.</p>
                    <p><pre><code>
                        .wrapper {
                            display: grid;
                            grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 200px);
                            gap: 10px;
                            grid-auto-flow: column;
                            grid-auto-columns: 300px 100px;
                        }
                    </code></pre></p>

                <h2>The order of auto placed items</h2>

                    <h3>Order modified document order</h3>

                <section>
                    <h3>Items with placement properties</h3>
                    <p>Items with placement properties such as <code>grid-column</code> and <code>grid-row</code> will be first placed, and then the other tiems will be auto-place in the spaces.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Deal with items that span tracks</h3>
                    <p>You can use placement properties while still taking advatange of auto-placement by using span with <code>grid-column-end</code> and/or <code>grid-row-end</code>. This would mean that the start line of the item will be set by auto placement, and the end line will span for however many tracks you want.</p>
                    <p><pre><code>
                        .wrapper {
                            display: grid;
                            grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
                            grid-auto-rows: 100px;
                            gap: 10px;
                          }
                          .wrapper div:nth-child(4n + 1) {
                            grid-column-end: span 2;
                            grid-row-end: span 2;
                            background-color: #ffa94d;
                        }
                    </code></pre></p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Filling in the gaps</h3>
                    <p>The grid is always progressing forward and keeping things in DOM order and sometimes leaves gaps if there is no element that would fit there. When we lay things out that don't have a logical order and we would like to create a layout that doesn't have gaps in it. To do this use property <code>grid-auto-flow</code> with value of <code>dense</code> to the container. for example <code>grid-auto-flow: column dense</code></p>
                    <p>Having done this, grid will not backfill the gaps, as it moves through the grid it leaves gaps as before, but then if it finds an item that will fit in the previous gap it will pick it up and take it out of DOM order to place it in a the gap.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Anonymous grid items</h3>
                    <p>These are created if you have a string of text inside your grid container that is not wrapped in any other element. The anonymous items will always be dealt with via the auto-placement rules.</p>
                    <p><pre><code>
                        &lt;div class="grid"&gt;
                            I am a string and will become an anonymous item
                            &lt;div&gt;A grid item&lt;/div&gt;
                            &lt;div&gt;A grid item&lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                    </code></pre></p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Use cases for auto-placement</h3>
                    <p><mark>Auto-placement is useful whnever you have a collection of items. That could be items that do not have a logical order such as a gallery of photos, or product listing.</mark> In that case you might choose to use the dense packing mode to fill in any holes in your grid.</p>
