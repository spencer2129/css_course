                <h2>What is a grid?</h2>
                <p>It is a set of intersecting horizaontal and vertical lines defining rows and columns. CSS grid layout has the following features:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Fixed and flexible track sizes</dt>
                    <dd>You can create a grid using fixed track sizes like pixels or you can use fleixble sizes with percentages or with the <code>fr unit.</code></dd>

                    <dt>Item Placement</dt>
                    <dd>You can place items into a precise location on the grid using line numbers, names or by targeting an area of the grid.</dd>

                    <dt>Creation of additional tracks to hold content</dt>
                    <dd>You can define an explicit grid with grid layout. The features defined by grid layout provide the flexibility to add additional rows and columns when needed.</dd>

                    <dt>Alignment control</dt>
                    <dd>The grid layout and box alignment feature enable us to control how the items align once placed in a grid area.</dd>

                    <dt>Control of overlapping content</dt>
                    <dd>More than one item can be placed into a grid cell or area nd they can partially overlap each other.</dd>
                </dl>

                <h2>Grid container</h2>
                <p>We create a grid container by declaring <code>display: grid</code> or <code>display: inline-grid</code> on an element. As soon as we do this, all direct children of that element become grid items.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>Grid tracks</h2>
                <p>We define rows and columns on our grid with the <code>grid-template-rows</code> and <code>grid-template-columns</code> properties. These define grid tracks. <mark>A grid track is the space between any two adjacent lines on the grid.</mark></p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Basic example</h3>
                    <p>
                        <pre>
                            <mark>Creates a grid with three 200-pixel-wide column tracks.</mark>
                            <code>
                                .wrapper {
                                    display: grid;
                                    grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 200px;
                                  }
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>The fr unit</h3>
                    <p>Tracks can be defined using any length unit. The <code>fr</code> unit represents a fraction of the available space in the grid container.</p>
                    <p>In this example we create three equal width tracks that grow and shrink according to the available space</p>
                    <p><code>grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;</code></p>
                    <p>You can also create tracks with different sizes</p>
                    <p><code>grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr;</code></p>
                    <p>You can also mix absolute sized tracks with <code>fr</code> units.</p>
                    <p>grid-template-columns: 500px 1fr 2fr;</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Track listings with repeat() notation</h3>
                    <p>Large grids with many tracks can use the <code>repeat()</code> notation to repeat all or a section of the list of grid tracks.</p>
                    <p><code>grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;</code> can be re-written as <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);</code></p>
                    <p>Repeat notation can be used for a part of the list tracks</p>
                    <p><code>grid-template-columns: 20px repeat(6, 1fr) 20px;</code></p>
                    <p>And repeat notation uses the track listing to create a repeating pattern of tracks.</p>
                    <p><code>grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr 2fr);</code></p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Implicit and explicit grids</h3>
                    <p>The <em>explicit grid</em> consists of rows and columns defined with <code>grid-template-columns</code> or <code>grid-template-rows</code>. The <em>implicit grid</em> extends the defined explicit grid when content is placed outside of that grid, such as into the rows by drawing additional grid lines.</p>
                    <p>If you place something outside of the defined grid--or due to the amount of content, more grid triacks are needed--then the grid creates rows and columns in the implicit grid. These tracks will be auto-sized by default, resulting in their size being based on the content that is inside them.</p>
                    <p>You can also define a set of size for tracks created in the <em>implicit grid</em> with the <code>grid-auto-rows</code> and <code>grid-auto-columns</code> properties.</p>
                    <p><pre><code>
                    .wrapper {
                        display: grid;
                        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
                        grid-auto-rows: 200px;
                      }
                    </code></pre> ensures that the tracks created in this implicit grid are <code>200px</code> tall.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Track sizing and minmax</h3>
                    <p>When setting up explicit grid or defining the sizing for automatically created rows or columns we may want to give tracks a minimun size, but also ensure they expand to fit any content that is added.</p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
                            .wrapper {
                                display: grid;
                                grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
                                grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);
                              }
                        </code></pre>
                        Automatically created rows will be a minimun of 100px tall, and have a maximun of auto. Setting <code>auto</code> as the maximun value means the size will stretch to fit the content, sizing the row based on the cell with the tallest content.

                <h2>Grid lines</h2>
                <p>When we define a grid, we define the grid tracks, not the lines. Grid then gives us numbered lines to use when positioning items.</p>
                <p>Lines are numbered according to the writing mode of the document. In a left-to-right language, line 1 is on the left-hand side of the grid. In a right-to-left language, it is on the right-hand side of the grid. Lines can also be named.</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Positioning items against lines</h3>
                    <p>When placing an item, we target the line rather than the track.</p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
                            .box1 {
                                grid-column-start: 1;
                                grid-column-end: 4;
                                grid-row-start: 1;
                                grid-row-end: 3;
                              }
                              
                              .box2 {
                                grid-column-start: 1;
                                grid-row-start: 3;
                                grid-row-end: 5;
                              }
                        </code></pre>

                    <h3>Line-positioning shorthands</h3>
                    <p>
                        This example give the same positioning as in the previous code.
                        <pre><code>

                                grid-row: 1 / 3;
                              }
                              
                              .box2 {
                                grid-column: 1;
                                grid-row: 3 / 5;
                              }

                <h2>Grid cells</h2>
                <p>A grid cell is the smallest unit on a grid. Conceptually it is like a table cell. Once a grid is defined as a parent, the child items will lay themselves out in one cell each of the defined grid.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>Grid areas</h2>
                <p>Items can span one or more cells both by row or by column, and this creates a grid area. Grid areas must be rectangular; it isn't possible to create an L-shaped area for example.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>Gutters</h2>
                <p>Gutters or alleys between grid cells can be created u sing the <code>column-gap</code> and <code>row-gap</code> properties, or the shorthand <code>gap</code>.</p>
                <p>
                    This adds a 10pixel gap between columns and a 1em gap between rows.
                    <pre><code>
                        .wrapper {
                            display: grid;
                            grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
                            column-gap: 10px;
                            row-gap: 1em;
                          }
                    </code></pre>
                </p>
                <p>Any space used by gaps will be accounted for before space is assigned to the flexible length <code>fr</code> tracks, and gaps act for sizing purposes like a regular grid track, however you cannot place anything into a gap. In terms of line-based positioning, the gap acts like a thick, transparent line.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>Nesting grids</h2>
                <p>A grid item can become a grid container.</p>
                <p>You can set <code>display: grid</code> on any of the grid cells and the cell will become a grid too. The nested items will layout on this new grid. However the nested grid has no relationship to the parent. It does not inherit the gap of the parent and the lines in the nested grid do not align to the lines in the parent grid</p>
                <p>In addition to regular grids, we can create subgrid. The <code>subgrid</code> value lets us create nested grids that use the track definition of the parent grid.</p>
                <p><code>grid-template-columns: subgrid</code></p>
                <p><code>grid-template-rows: subgrid</code></p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h2>Layering items with z-index</h2>
                <p>Grid items can occupy the same cell, and in this case we can use the <code>z-index</code> property to control the order in which overlapping items stack.</p>
                <p>In a grid example, lets stay box2 is overlapping box1 because the element comes later in the source order. By giving box2 a lower <code>z-index</code> than box1, it will display below box1 in the stack even though the element has later in the source order.</p>
