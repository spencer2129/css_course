        <p><strong>Specificity</strong> is the <em>algorithm</em> used by browsers to determine the CSS declaration that is the most releveant to an element, which in turn, determines the property value to apply to the element. The specificity algorithm calculates the weight of a CSS selector to determine which rule from competing CSS declarations sgets applied to an element.</p>

        <p><strong>Important: </strong>Browsers consider specificity after determining cascade origin and importance. In other words, for competing property declarations, specificity is relevant and compared only between selectors from the one cascade origin and layer that has precedence for the property. Scoping proximity and order of appearance bcome relevant whent he selector specificities of the competing delcarations in the cascade layer with precedence are equal!</p>
