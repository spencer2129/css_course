    <main>
        <p><strong>Specificity</strong> is the <em>algorithm</em> used by browsers to determine the CSS declaration that is the most releveant to an element, which in turn, determines the property value to apply to the element. The specificity algorithm calculates the weight of a CSS selector to determine which rule from competing CSS declarations sgets applied to an element.</p>

        <p><strong>Important: </strong>Browsers consider specificity after determining cascade origin and importance. In other words, for competing property declarations, specificity is relevant and compared only between selectors from the one cascade origin and layer that has precedence for the property. Scoping proximity and order of appearance bcome relevant whent he selector specificities of the competing delcarations in the cascade layer with precedence are equal!</p>

            <h2>How is specificity calculated?</h2>
            <p>Specificity is an algorithm that calculates the weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration. The weight is determined by the number of selectors of each weight category in the selector matching the element. If there are two or more declarations providing different property values for the same element, the declaration value in the style block having the matching selector with the greatest algorithmic weight gets applied.</p>

            <p>The specificity algorithm is basically a three-column value of three categories or weights - ID, CLASS, and TYPE - corresponding to the three types of selectors. The value represents the count of selector components in each weight category and is written as ID - CLASS - TYPE. The three columns are created by counting the number of selector components for each selector weight category in the selectors that match the element.</p>

                <h3>Matching selector</h3>

                <p>The specificity weight comes from the matching selector.</p>
                <pre><code>
                    [type="password"],
                    input:focus,
                    :root #myApp input:required {
                        color: blue;
                    }
                </code></pre>
                <p>The selector <code>[type="password"]</code> with a specificity of <code>0-1-0</code> applies the <code>color:blue</code> declaration to all password input types</p>
                
                <p>The <code>input:focus</code> selector with a weight of <code>0-1-1</code> applies to all inputs, no matter the type, when receiving focus. This weight is made up of the <code>:focus</code> pseudo-class (0-1-0) and the <code>input</code> type (0-0-1). If the password input has focus, it will match the <code>input:focus</code> selector., and the specificity weight for the <code>color:blue</code> style declaration will be <code>0-1-1</code>. When the password doesn't have focus, the specificity weight remains at <code>0-1-0</code> matching the <code>[type="password"]</code> selector.</p>

                <p>The <code>:root #myApp input:required</code> selector with specificity of <code>1-2-1</code> is based on one ID, two pseudo-classes, and one element type. This selector applies to all required inputs nested in an element with attribute <code>id="myApp"</code></p>

                <p>In this example if the password input type with required is nested in an element with <code>id="myApp"</code> set, the specificity weight will be <code>1-2-1</code> regardless whether or not it has focus. Why is the weight not <code>0-1-1</code> or <code>0-1-0</code>? This is because the specificity weight comes from the matching selector with the greatest specificity weight. The weight is determined by comparing the values in the three columns, from left to right.</p>

                <pre><code>
                    [type="password"] {
                        /* 0-1-0 */
                      }
                      input:focus {
                        /* 0-1-1 */
                      }
                      :root #myApp input:required {
                        /* 1-2-1 */
                      }
                </code></pre>

                <h3>Three-column comparison</h3>

                <p>Once the specificity values of the relevant selectors are determined, the number of selector components in each column are compared, from left to right.</p>

                <pre><code>
                    /* The first column is the value of the ID component. The selector with the greater value in the ID column wins no matter what are the values in the other columns */

                <h3>The <code>:is()</code>, <code>:not()</code>, <code>:has()</code> and CSS nesting exception</h3>

                <p>The matches-any pseudo-class <code>:is()</code>, the relational pseudo-class <code>:has()</code>, and the negation pseudo-class <code>:not()</code> are not considered as pseudo-classes in the specificity weight calculation. They themselves don't add any weight to the specificity equation. However, the selector parameters passed into the pseudo-class parenthesis are part of the specificity algorithm; the weight of the matches-any and negation pseudo-class in the specificity value calculation is the weight of the parameter's weight.</p>

                <p><strong>Note: </strong>The specificity weight provided by the <code>:is()</code>, <code>:has()</code> and <code>:not()</code> pseudo-classes is the value of selector parameter, not of the pseudo-class.</p>

                <p>All three of the pseudo-classes accept complex selector lists, a list of comma-separated selectors, as a parameter. This feature can be used to increase a selectors specificity.</p>

                <pre><code>
                    :is(p, #fakeId) {
                    /* 1-0-0 */
                    }
                    h1:has(+ h2, > #fakeId) {
                    /* 1-0-1 */
                    }
                    p:not(#fakeId) {
                    /* 1-0-1 */
                    }
                    div:not(.inner, #fakeId) p {
                    /* 1-0-2 */
                    }
                </code></pre>

                <p>In the example above, the <code>#fakeId</code> adds <code>1-0-0</code> to the specificity weight of each paragraph.</p>

                <pre><code>
                    /* When creating complex selector lists with CSS nesting this behaves in exactly the same way as the :is() pseudo-class */

                    p,
                    #fakeId {
                        span {
                            /* 1-0-1 */
                        }
                    }
                </code></pre>
                <p>The code above the specificity is taken from <code>#fakeId</code> and also <code>span</code>, so this create a specificity of <code>1-0-1</code> for both <code>p span</code> and <code>#fakeId span</code>. This is the equivalent as <code>:is(p, #fakeId) span</code> selector.</p>

                <h3>Inline styles</h3>
                <p>Inline styles added to an element (e.g., <code>style="font-weight: bold;"</code>) always overwrite any normal styles in author stylesheets. Inline styles actually have a higher precedence in the cascade order. You can think of it having a specificity of <code>1-0-0-0</code>, although in reality its not the specificity, but the cascade order precedence that is higher.</p>

                <p>The only way to overwrite it is by using the <code>!important</code> value in your author stylesheet. However, it will be overwritten, NOT because of specificity, but because of the higher precedence in the cascade order.</p>

                <pre><code>
                    p[style*="purple"] {
                        color: rebeccapurple !important;
                      }
                </code></pre>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>The <code>!important</code> exception</h3>
                <p>CSS declarations marked as imortant override any other declarations within the same cascade layer and origin. Although technically, <code>!important</code> has nothing to do with specificity, it interacts directly with specificity and the cascade. It reverses the cascade order of stylesheets.</p>

                <p>If declarations from the same origin and cascade layer conflict and one property value has the <code>!important</code> flag set, the important delcaration is applied no matter the specificity. When conflicting declarations from the same origin and cascade layer with the <code>!important</code> flag are applied to the same element, the declaration with a greater specificity is applied.</p>

                <p>Using <code>!important</code> to override specificity is considered a bad practice. Understanding specificity and cascade order should remove any need for the <code>!important</code> flag.</p>

                <p>One big tip if you're using CSS external libraries, is to instead of using <code>!important</code> to override CSS from external libraries, import the third-party scripts directly into cascade layers.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>The <code>:where()</code> exception</h3>
                <p>The specificity-adjustment pseudo-class <code>:where()</code> always has its specificity replaced with zero, <code>0-0-0</code>. It takes a selector list as its argument, and selects any element that can be selected by one of the selectors in that list.</p>

                <p>The difference between <code>:where()</code> and <code>:is()</code> is that <code>:where()</code> always has 0 specificity, where as <code>:is()</code> takes on the specificity of the most specific selector in its arguments.</p>

                <pre><code>
                    :where(#defaultTheme) a {
                        /* 0-0-1 */
                        color: red;
                    }
                </code></pre>

                <p>In creating third-party CSS to be sued by developers who don't have access to edit your CSS, it is considered a good practice to create CSS witht lowest possible specificity using <code>:where()</code> as in the example above.  Then developers implementing the widget can easily override the link color using only type selectors.</p>

                <pre><code>
                    footer a {
                        /* 0-0-2 */
                        color: blue;
                    }
                </code></pre>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>How <code>@scope</code> block affect specificity</h3>
                <p>The <code>@scope</code> CSS at-rule enables you to select elements in specific DOM subtrees, targeting elements precisely without writing overly-specific selectors that are hard to override, and without coupling your selectors too tightly to the DOM structure.</p>

                <p>Including a ruleset inside a <code>@scope</code> block does not affect the specificity of its selector, regardless of the selectors used inside the scope root and limit.</p>

                <pre><code>
                    @scope (.article-body) {
                        /* img has a specificity of 0-0-1, as expected */
                        img {
                        }
                    }
                </code></pre>

                <p>If you decide to prepend the <code>:scope</code> pseudo-class to your scoped selectors, youll need to factor it in when calculating their specificity.</p>

                <pre><code>
                    @scope (.article-body) {
                        /* :scope img has a specificity of 0-1-0 + 0-0-1 = 0-1-1 */
                        :scope img {
                        }
                    }
                </code></pre>

                <p>When using the <code>&</code> selector inside a <code>@scope</code> block, <code>&</code> represents the scope root selector; it is internally rewritten to that selector wrapped inside an <code>:is()</code> selector.</p>

                <pre><code>
                    @scope (figure, #primary) {
                        & img {
                        }
                    }

                    /* & img is equivalent to :is(figure, $primary) img.*/
                </code></pre>
                <p>Since <code>:is()</code> takes the specificity of its most specific argument(<code>#primary</code>, in this case), the specificity of the scoped <code>& img</code> selector is therefore 1-0-0 + 0-0-1 = 1-0-1</p>

            <h2>Tips for handling specificity headaches</h2>
            <p>Instead of using <code>!important</code> consider using the cascade layers and using low weight specificity throughout your CSS so that styles are easily overridden with slightly more specific rules. Using semantic HTML helps provide anchors from which to apply styling.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Making selectors specific with and without adding specificity</h3>
                
                <p>By indicating the section of the document you're styling before the element you're selecting, the rule becomes more specific. Depending on how you add it, you can add some, a lot, or no specificy.</p>

                <pre><code>
                    &lt;main id="myContent"&gt;
                        &lt;h1&gt;Text&lt;/h1&gt;
                    &lt;/main&gt;

                    #myContent h1 {
                        color: green; /* 1-0-1 */
                    }
                    [id="myContent"] h1 {
                        color: yellow; /* 0-1-1 */
                    }
                    :where(#myContent) h1 {
                        color: blue; /* 0-0-1 */
                    }

                    /* No matter the order, the heading will be green because that rule is the most specific.*/
                </code></pre>

                <h3>Reducing ID specificity</h3>

                <p>Specificity is based on the form of a selector. Including the <code>id</code> of an element as an attribute selector rather than an id selector is a good way to make an element more specific without adding an overabundance of specificity. In the previous example, the selector <code>[id="myContent"]</code> counts as an attribute selector for the purpose of determining the selector's specificity, even though it selects an ID.</p>
                <p>You can also include the <code>id</code> or any part of a selector as a parameter in the <code>:where()</code> specificity adjustment pseudo class if you need to make a selector more specific but don't want to add any specificity at all.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Increasing specificity by duplicating selector</h3>
                <p>As a special case for increasing specificity, you can duplicate weights from the CLASS or ID columns. Duplicating id, class, pseudo-class or attribute selectors within a compound selector will increase specificity when overriding very specific selectors over which you have no control.</p>

                <p>Leveraging cascade layers is the standard way of enabling one set of styles to take precedence over another set of styles; cascade layers enable this without using specificity. Normal (not important) author styles imported into cascade layers have lower precedence than unlayered author styles.</p>

                <p>If styles are coming from a stylesheet that you can't edit or don't understand and you need to override styles, a strategy is to import the styles you don't control into a cascade layer. Styles in subsequently declared layers take precedence, with unlayered styles have precedence over all layered styles from the same origin.</p>

                <h3>Avoiding and overriding <code>!important</code></h3>

                <p>The best approach is to not use <code>!important</code></p>

                <p>To remove the perceived need for <code>!important</code>, do one of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increase the specificity of the selector of the formerly <code>!important</code> declaration so that it is greater than other declarations.</li>
                </ul>
