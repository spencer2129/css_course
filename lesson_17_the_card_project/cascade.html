            <p>The cascade is an algorithm that defines how user agents combine property values originating from different sources. The cascade defines the origin and layer that takes precedence when declarations in more than one origin, cascade layer or scope block set a value for a property on an element.</p>

            <p>When a selector matches an element, the property value from the origin with the highest precedence gets applied, even if the selector from a lower preceence origin or layer has greater specificity.</p>

            <h2>Origin types</h2>
            <p>The cascade algorithm's job is to select CSS delcarations in order to determine the correct value for CSS properties.</p>
            <p>CSS declarations come from different origin types:</p>
                
            <dl>
                <dt>user-agent stylesheet</dt>
                <dd>user-agents or browsers have basic stylesheets that give default styles to any document.</dd>
                <dd>Lowest precedence below user stylesheet and author stylesheets.</dd>

                <dt>author stylesheets</dt>
                <dd>Stylesheets written by web devlopers.</dd>

                <dt>user stylesheets</dt>
                <dd>In some or most browsers, the user of the website can choose to orverride styles using a custom user stylesheet. This is different than making changes in the devtool.</dd>

                <dt>cascade layers</dt>
                <dd>The cascade order is based on origin type</dd>
                <dd>The cascade within each origin type is based on the declaration order of cascade layers within that type.</dd>

            <h2>Cascading Order</h2>
            <p>The cascading algorithm determines how to find the value to apply for each property for each documenet element. The following steps apply to the cascading algorithm.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Relevance: </strong>It first filters all the rules from the different sources to keep only the rules that appply to a given element. That means rules whose selector matches the given element and which are part of an appropriate media at-rule.</li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Origin and importance: </strong>Then it sorts these rules according to their importance, that is, whether or not they followed by <code>!important</code>, and by their origin.

                <li><strong>Specificity: </strong>In case of equality with an origin, the specificity of a rule is considered to choose on value or another. The specificity of the selectors are compared, and the declaration with the highest specificity wins.</li>

                <li><strong>Scoping proximity: </strong>When two selectors in the origin layer with precedence have the same specificity, the property value within scoped rules with the smallest number of hops up the DOM hierarchy to the scrop root wins.</li>

                <li><strong>Order of appearance: </strong>In the origin with precedence, if there are competing values for a property that are in style block matching selectors of equal specificity and scoping proximity, the last declaration in the style order is applied.</li>

            <h2>Author styles: inline styles, layers and precedence</h2>
            <p>Styles can be contained within layers within their origin type, and with author styles, there is also the issue of where inline styles land in the cascade order.</p>

            <p>The order in which layers are declared is important in determining precedence. Normal styles in a layer take precedence over styles declared in prior layers; with normal styles declard outside of any layer taking precedence over normal layered styles regardless of specificity.</p>

            <p>The layer order of precedence is inverted for styles delcared as <code>!important</code>. Important declarations found in a layer take precedence over important declarations found outside of a layer. Important delcarations found in the first layer (A) take precedence over important delcarations found in layer C, which take precedence over important declarations found outside of a layer.</p>

                <h3>Inline style</h3>
                <p>Only relevant to author styles are inline styles, delcared with the <code>style</code> attribute. Normal inline styles take precedence over any other normal author styles, no matter the specificity of the selector. Normal inline styles do no take precedence over animated or transitioned properties</p>

                <p>Important inline styles take precedence over all other author styles. Three things can override an important inline style</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>An imporatnt user style</li>
                    <li>An important user agent style</li>
                    <li>A transitioned property</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Importance and layers</h3>
                <p>The origin type precedence order is inverted for important styles. Important styles delcared outside of any cascade layer have lower precedence than those delcared as part of a layer. Important styles that come in early layers take precedence over important layers declared in subsequent cascade layers.</p>

                <p><strong>Note: </strong>The <code>!important</code> flag reverses the precedence of cascade layers. For this reason, try not to use <code>!important</code> to override external sty les. Instead, use <code>@import</code> together with the <code>layer</code> keyword or <code>layer()</code> function to important external stylesheets (from frameworks, widget stylesheets, libraries, etc) into layers. Importing stylesheets into a layer as the first declaration in your CSS demotes their precedence, and author-defined layers, defined later in your CSS, will have higher precedence. The <code>!important</code> flag should only be used sparingly, if ever, to guard required styles against later overrides, in the first declared layer.</p>

            <h2>Which CSS entities participate in the cascade</h2>
            <p>Only CSS property/value pair declaration participate in the cascade.  CSS at-rule descriptors don't participate in the cascade and HTML presentational attributes are not part of the cascade.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>At-rules</h3>
                <p>CSS at-rules containing entities other than declarations, such as a <code>@font-face</code> rule containing descriptors, don't participate in the cascade.</p>

                <p>When it comes to <code>@import</code>, the <code>@import</code> doesn't participate itself in the cascade, but all of the imported styles do participate. If the <code>@import</code> defines a named or anonymous layer, the contents of the imported stylesheet are placed into the specified layer. All other CSS immported with <code>@import</code> is treated as the last declared layer.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Presentational attributes</h3>
                <p>Presentational attributes are attributes in the source document that can affect styling. While they are author styles, presentational attributes do not participate in the cascade.</p>

            <h2>CSS animations and the cascade</h2>
            <p>CSS animations, using <code>@keyframes</code> at-rules, define animations between states. <code>@keyframes</code> don't cascade, meaning that at any given time CSS takes values from only one single set of <code>@keyframes</code> and never mixes multiple ones. If multiple set of <code>@keyframes</code> are defined with the same animation name, the last defined set in the origin and layer with the greatest precedence is used.</p>

            <p><strong>Note: </strong>There are no important animations, as property declarations in a <code>@keyframes</code> block that contain <code>!important</code> as part of the value are ignored.</p>

            <h2>Resetting styles</h2>
            <p>After your content has finished altering styles, it may find itself in a situation where it needs to restore them to a known state. This may happen in cases of animations, theme changes, and so forth. The CSS property <code>all</code> lets you quickly set almost everything in CSS back to a known state.</p>

            <p><code>all</code> lets you opt to immediately restore all properties to any of their initial (default) state, the state inherited from the previous level of the cascade, a specific origin (the user-agent stylesheet, the author stylesheet, or the user stylesheet), or even to clear the values of the properites entirely.</p>
